# Palindromes
I have two different solutions here:

1. Evaluate if a single word is palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.

2. If rearranging the characters of a string can happen into a Palindrome, it retrieves it.

For example, `oos` could be turned into `oso`, which is a palindrome
Another example is `cviic`, which could be turned into `civic` or `icvci`
